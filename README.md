# Cassowary
Cassowary is a framework for writing emulators in C#.  Currently, the only available core is for the NES.  The design of the NES core is intended to be readable and to mirror the implementation details of the original hardware rather than to be highly optimized.

Plenty of stuff doesn't work yet, but many games are playable.
